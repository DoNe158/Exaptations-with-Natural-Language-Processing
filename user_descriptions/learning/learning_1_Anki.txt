I use this app mainly for learning, especially things that I need to memorize. In addition, I find the spaced repetition system very practical, because then I don't have to worry about when I repeat which content. Then I also use the app to write smaller summaries. This way, I can put all the important aspects in one pile. If I then want to refer back to the content in a later semester, for example, I don't have to search through everything. I mainly use the app to memorize content and keep an eye on the big picture. When I write summaries, I use a heading or the name of the subchapter for the front and the associated content on the corresponding back.
