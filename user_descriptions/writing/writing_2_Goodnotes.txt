I use this app for taking notes from lectures, but also to look at summaries. 
In addition, I also write learning plans and overviews or to-dos, so that I know on which day I have which task ahead of me. 
From time to time I also use the app for creative work, e.g. to think up patterns, draw them and then convert them into PDFs.
